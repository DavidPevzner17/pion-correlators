Since its inception in the 1970s, lattice QCD has revolutionized the study of quantum particles, allowing extremely difficult or even impossible QFT calculations to be done computationally and, providing an effective way to compare theoretical predictions with experiment. In this paper, we investigate the application of quenched lattice QCD in verifying the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, which states that the squared pion mass is proportional to the sum of the up and down quarks. In our simulation, we limited ourselves to large simulated quark masses, ultimately concluding that some improvements to our simulation need to be made before it can accurately verify the GMOR relation.
